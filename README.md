# NextDepartures

Next Departures lets you check the closest public transport stops from where you are. You can save your favourite stops and track when you are about to arrive to your target destination.

The app currently only consumes PTV (Public Transport Victoria) data - https://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/ptv-timetable-api.

## Next Departures Functionality

The app lets you achieve the following tasks:
- A user is able to retrieve the different public transport stops nearby. 
- Check the stop nearby in a map and distance from current location.
- Get the next available public transport services stopping at a specific stop by just tapping the stop in the map.
- The information displayed to the user is realtime when available.
- Select a service to see the complete route.
  - When viewing the route of a service, you can tap on a stop and select if you want to be notified when you are close to it (tracking stop).
- Stop tracking
  - When creating a tracking stop, the user is able to select how far away from a stop they want to be notified - 200m, 500m or 1km.
  - Keep tracking of stops.
  - Enable/Disable tracking stops.
  - Remove tracking stops.
- Favourite stops
  - Add favourite stops.
  - Check services in your favourite stops.
  - Quick access to your favourite stops.
- An Apple Watch app has been created for this App.
  - Glances: View the next public transport service from your closest favourite stop.
  - Interface: You'll see all the services shown in the Next Departures iPhone App. If a service is selected, a new view will slide and show the location of the stop.
- Two GPXs files have been included in the Project. One to simulate Melbourne CBD location and another one to simulate the route taken by a public transport service (from Melbourne CBD to St. Kilda Rd)  

**Important:** In order to be able to use the app, you'll need to simulate your location to Melbourne, Australia. A GPX file has been included in the Project to simulate the location of Melbourne CBD.
